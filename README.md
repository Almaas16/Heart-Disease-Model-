# Heart-Disease-Model-
1. Heart Disease ML Model:- Designed a an Machine learning model, which can be used to predict whether a person has heart disease or not based on various parameters like (Age, Sex, Cholestrol , Blood pressure etc.)

2. Description:-
   Developed a healthcare model to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning algorithms.
   Leveraging a dataset of patient medical records, implementing some of ML techniques such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and 
   Scikit Learn to build an accurate and scalable prediction system.

3. The model was designed using following:-
   Framework:- Jupyter Notebook
   Python libraries
   • Numpy - Python library primarily used for numerical computing, particularly for scientific and data analysis tasks
   • Pandas - Python library used for data manipulation and analysis
   • Matplotlib - Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
   • Scikit learn - Python library used for performing various ML tasks such as classification, regression etc.

5. Data Source:- Heart-disease.csv imported from Kaggle
